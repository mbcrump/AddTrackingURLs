#### Quickly Set Up Azure Active Directory with Azure App Services

A while ago, I did a post on [Quick and Dirty User Authentication with Azure Web Apps and MVC5](/blog/tip112), where I created a simple web app that used forms authentication. Since then, I’ve been asked if I could address how to use the **Settings -> Authentication / Authorization** feature to turn on AAD for an existing web app. In this post, we’ll take a look at setting up Azure Active Directory with Azure App Services.

#### My Requirements

*	Any user on my AAD will be able to log in.
*	I won’t write or add any code to my web app.
*	I want to do this with the FREE Tier of Azure App Service Web Apps.

#### How to Set Up Azure Active Directory with an App Service Web App
Go to the Azure portal and select my web app and click on **Authentication / Authorization** under **Settings** to get started.

Click the **On** button to see the Authentication Provider list and then click **Azure Active Directory** in the list of providers.

Great. Now click on the **Express** management mode button and click **OK**.

Now you’ll need to do one last thing before saving the Authentication / Authorization settings, which is to set the **Action to take when a request is not authenticated**. You’ll want to make sure that it is set to **Log in with Azure Active Directory**. This makes sure anyone visiting your site has been authenticated by AAD first.  If you are following along and find that you want to use a different AAD tenant (not the Azure account you usually sign into), you can find those steps here: Manually configure Azure Active Directory with advanced settings.

Now you can click the **Save** button to have AAD added as your Authentication Provider.
